## 🤔 Who Am I?

I'm the **Swiss Army Knife of Data** – equal parts **SQL Sorcerer**, **Tableau Tinkerer**, and **Azure Cloud Wrangler**. If there's data, I'm here to structure it, visualize it, and toss it into the cloud faster than you can say `SELECT * FROM life`.

- **SQL DBA**: I make databases faster than a coffee-fueled cheetah and more reliable than your Wi-Fi on a Monday morning. I optimize queries like it's a sport—catch me indexing all day.  
- **Tableau Developer**: If data were a canvas, I'd be Picasso (but with more structured dashboards and fewer weird faces). Let me turn those dry numbers into beautiful visuals that even your grandma can understand.  
- **Azure Data Engineer**: I live in the cloud, and not just because it sounds cool. Whether it's building pipelines or deploying massive data systems, I've got my head in the Azure clouds but my feet firmly on the data ground.

When I’m not fixing a query that someone accidentally turned into a 10-minute monster or building a dashboard that looks more like a work of art, I’m probably dreaming about ETL pipelines. Basically, I’m a data nerd with a cool title.

## 🌍 Where to Find Me

You can catch me in various corners of the internet, trying to balance SQL queries, dashboards, and cloud infrastructure... while probably drinking way too much coffee:

- 🐦 **Twitter**: Tweeting random thoughts about SQL, data, and life’s mysteries (and possibly memes) at [@snippyguy](https://twitter.com/snippyguy)  
- 💼 **LinkedIn**: Looking professionally serious (while secretly hoping someone brings up data jokes) at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/snippyguy/)  
- 🧑‍💻 **Stack Overflow**: Helping (and getting helped by) other coders who, like me, forgot a semicolon somewhere. [Check it out](https://stackoverflow.com/users/yourhandle)  
- 📸 **Tableau Public**: Where my data visualizations and coffee pics get equal attention. [Follow along](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/snippyguy/vizzes)  
- 💬 **Slack**: Probably chatting about databases, Azure pipelines, or just the latest tech trends. Hit me up on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/yourhandle)

When I’m not in one of these places, I’m probably lost deep inside a SQL query or debugging some ETL process. Don’t worry, I’ll resurface... eventually!
