# Data-Engineering
This project showcases my data engineering skills by building a complete end-to-end pipeline. It includes data ingestion, transformation, and storage using a combination of cloud platforms, databases, and ETL processes. The project demonstrates how to handle large-scale datasets, ensuring efficient data flow and integration.
Hereâ€™s a funny and unique "Who am I" section for your GitHub README as a SQL DBA, Tableau Developer, and Azure Data Engineer:

## ðŸ¤” Who Am I?

I'm the **Swiss Army Knife of Data** â€“ equal parts **SQL Sorcerer**, **Tableau Tinkerer**, and **Azure Cloud Wrangler**. If there's data, I'm here to structure it, visualize it, and toss it into the cloud faster than you can say `SELECT * FROM life`.

- **SQL DBA**: I make databases faster than a coffee-fueled cheetah and more reliable than your Wi-Fi on a Monday morning. I optimize queries like it's a sportâ€”catch me indexing all day.  
- **Tableau Developer**: If data were a canvas, I'd be Picasso (but with more structured dashboards and fewer weird faces). Let me turn those dry numbers into beautiful visuals that even your grandma can understand.  
- **Azure Data Engineer**: I live in the cloud, and not just because it sounds cool. Whether it's building pipelines or deploying massive data systems, I've got my head in the Azure clouds but my feet firmly on the data ground.

When Iâ€™m not fixing a query that someone accidentally turned into a 10-minute monster or building a dashboard that looks more like a work of art, Iâ€™m probably dreaming about ETL pipelines. Basically, Iâ€™m a data nerd with a cool title.
