# ðŸ“Š Data Engineering Project: [Project Name] ðŸš€

**Overview**  
Welcome to the **[Project Name]** repository! This project demonstrates the creation of a robust, scalable data engineering pipeline from end to end. It covers data ingestion, transformation, and visualization, leveraging modern cloud technologies and best practices in data engineering. The project simulates real-world data processing challenges and showcases efficient solutions.

**Objectives**  
- Extract raw data from multiple sources (APIs, databases, and flat files).
- Transform and clean data using optimized ETL processes.
- Load and store data in a structured format for analytics.
- Create interactive data visualizations to uncover insights.

**Tech Stack**  
- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestrates the ETL process in the cloud.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Scalable storage for raw and processed data.
- **SQL Server**: Relational database to store and manage processed data.
- **Python**: Scripts for data cleaning, transformation, and automation.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for data visualization.
- **PowerShell**: Automated deployment and management scripts.

**Pipeline Architecture**  
1. **Data Ingestion**: Automates the extraction of raw data from various sources.
2. **Data Transformation**: Cleans, transforms, and aggregates data for analysis.
3. **Data Storage**: Saves processed data in a SQL database for long-term storage.
4. **Data Visualization**: Uses Tableau to visualize KPIs and trends with intuitive dashboards.

**Key Features**  
- ðŸ“¥ **Automated Data Ingestion**: Seamlessly pulls data from APIs, databases, and cloud storage.
- ðŸ›  **ETL Pipelines**: Efficient ETL workflows to process large datasets with minimal downtime.
- ðŸš¦ **Monitoring & Logging**: Integrated monitoring to track pipeline performance and alert on failures.
- ðŸ“Š **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizes data insights with filters and drill-down capabilities.

**How to Use**  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Configure environment variables and API keys.
3. Run the data pipeline scripts to begin data processing.
4. Visualize the results using the Tableau dashboard included in the repository.
